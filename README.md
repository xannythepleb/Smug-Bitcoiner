# Snobby Bitcoiner Price Tracker

## Overview
Created on a lark so that you can lookup the price of Bitcoin on any given date so if someone said "Bitcoin is a scam" you can tell them how much it's increased since they said it, hence the name, but it's also a useful tool for checking out what's been going on in Bitcoin since the last time you stacked sats or even when you first bought some in 2011.
